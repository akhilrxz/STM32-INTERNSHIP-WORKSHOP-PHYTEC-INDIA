# STM32-INTERNSHIP-WORKSHOP-PHYTEC-INDIA

Welcome to my STM32 workshop repository! This project is a culmination of various exercises and implementations conducted during my workshop on the STM32 Cortex-M architecture, specifically using the PHYTEC InDIA environment.

***********************************************Overview*********************************************************

In this workshop, I explored and implemented various features of the STM32 Cortex-M microcontroller, focusing on different serial peripheral interfaces (SPIs) and integrating various sensors and actuators. The project includes code and configurations for:-

Serial Peripheral Interfaces: SPI, I2C,uart,usart
Sensors: Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), RFID Reader
Actuators: Servo Motors
Additional Features: LCD Display, LED Control, and more
